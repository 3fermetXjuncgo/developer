One of the features of Halo Reach is the Recreational Protocols, a set of rules and guidelines that govern the behavior and interactions of players in multiplayer modes. The Recreational Protocols are designed to ensure a fair and fun gaming experience for everyone, and to prevent cheating, griefing, harassment, and other forms of misconduct. The Recreational Protocols are enforced by the UNSC (United Nations Space Command), the military organization that oversees human affairs in the Halo universe.
 
The Recreational Protocols cover various aspects of multiplayer gameplay, such as matchmaking, communication, scoring, ranking, reporting, banning, and more. Some examples of Recreational Protocols are:
 
- Players must respect each other and avoid offensive or abusive language, gestures, or actions.
- Players must not use glitches, exploits, hacks, mods, or external devices to gain an unfair advantage or disrupt the game.
- Players must not quit or idle excessively during matches, or interfere with other players' progress.
- Players must not team kill, betray, or sabotage their teammates or allies.
- Players must not impersonate or falsely represent other players, groups, or organizations.
- Players must follow the rules and objectives of each game mode and map.
- Players must report any violations of the Recreational Protocols to the UNSC authorities.

Violating the Recreational Protocols may result in penalties such as warnings, temporary bans, permanent bans, rank resets, or legal actions. The severity of the penalty depends on the nature and frequency of the violation. The UNSC reserves the right to modify or update the Recreational Protocols at any time without prior notice.
 
The Recreational Protocols are intended to create a safe and enjoyable environment for all Halo Reach players. By following them, players can have fun and compete with each other in a respectful and sportsmanlike manner. The Recreational Protocols are part of what makes Halo Reach a great game for everyone.
  
Halo Reach offers a variety of gameplay modes and features that cater to different play styles and preferences. Some of these modes and features are:

- Campaign: The main story mode of Halo Reach, where players can play solo or cooperatively with up to three other players. The campaign consists of 11 missions that chronicle the events of the Fall of Reach from the perspective of Noble Team. The campaign also features hidden collectibles called Data Pads that reveal more lore and secrets about the Halo universe.
- Multiplayer: The online competitive mode of Halo Reach, where players can battle against each other or team up in various game types and maps. The multiplayer mode also includes Firefight, a cooperative mode where players must survive waves of enemies with limited resources and lives. The multiplayer mode features a ranking system based on credits (cR) that players earn by playing matches and completing challenges. Credits can be used to purchase armor permutations, armor effects, emblems, and other customization options for the player's Spartan.
- Forge: A map editing tool that allows players to create, modify, and share their own maps and game modes. Forge enables players to manipulate objects, spawn points, weapons, vehicles, and more on existing maps or on a blank canvas called Forge World. Forge also allows players to test their creations in real time with other players.
- Theater: A replay mode that allows players to watch, record, edit, and share footage of their gameplay. Theater enables players to view their gameplay from different angles, pause, rewind, fast forward, and take screenshots. Theater also allows players to upload their clips and screenshots to their File Share, a online storage system that can be accessed by other players.
